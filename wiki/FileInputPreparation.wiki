#summary Explanation of the steps necessary to prepare c# source files for parsing.

=Intro=
Parsing c`#` source files works best, if files are encoded *ISO-8859-1* with *\r\n* as the line terminator. UTF-8 encoded files will cause trouble when parsing. To ensure files are of the appropriate encoding before parsing, a pre-processing tool was created.

==Tool Usage==
The tool expects the following command line parameters:
 # input directory
 # regEx of files to convert
 # debug?

*example:*
{{{

"/Users/janschumacher/tmp/ARTSvn/trunk/ART/src" ".*\.cs$" "true"
}}}
