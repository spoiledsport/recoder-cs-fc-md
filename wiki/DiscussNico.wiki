 * how should WMC be defined, based on CYCLO
  * i followed the definition of it in the code wizard testcase for it
  * do we count the cases/default in a switch or just the switch
  * adapt test case?

 * WMC, how should we wight stuff? LOC?
  * currently nothing is wweighted.

 * really, what classes do we consider, when calculating metrics?
 * if the measured entity is method, do i consider abstract classes?
