

This directory contains the JavaCC parser for Recoder C#.
The *.java and *.html patterns are included in the .cvsignore file.
There is a genparser rule in the build.xml file, which builds the parser
and copies the resulting files to src/recoder/parser.
You have to set the javacc.bin property to point to your javacc executable.
